## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Structure

This extension is built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* **`manifest.json`**: The blueprint of the extension, defining permissions, background script, popup, and other metadata.
* **`background.js`**: The service worker, running in the background. It listens for browser events (like tab activation) to ensure the `content.js` is available.
* **`popup.html` / `popup.js` / `styles/popup.css`**: The user interface that appears when you click the extension icon. It allows you to toggle the sparkle pen and customize its settings. It communicates with the `content.js` to control the effects.
* **`content.js`**: Injected directly into the active web page. This script creates the canvas overlay, listens for mouse movements, draws the sparkle particles, and manages the particle animation loop based on user settings.
* **`icons/`**: Contains the extension icons in various sizes.

## üêõ Debugging

* Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
* Ensure "Developer mode" is on.
* For `background.js` issues, click "Service worker" under the Sparkle Pen extension.
* For `popup.js` / `popup.html` issues, click "popup.html" under the Sparkle Pen extension.
* For `content.js` issues (especially related to drawing/interactions on the webpage), right-click anywhere on the webpage where the extension is active, select "Inspect", and choose the `sparklePenCanvas` or the content script context in the Developer Tools console/sources tab.
